# homepage

## Project Description

This project is a part of the Odin Project curriculum, and is a responsive homepage that contains some portfolio pieces with a short description of each project. This project's main purpose was to solidify my understanding of responsive design as well as web accessibility.

I wanted to practice implementing different types of animation and interactivity into this project using only CSS animations and transitions. I did run into some challenges when layering animations but was able to figure out how to freeze the transition state of the animated element in order to add interactive transitions on mouse hover.
